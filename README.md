Iris DataSet Analysis

The Iris Data Set
Introduction:

The Iris Data Set consist of 50 samples from each of the three species of Iris flower (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor) . The features or variables present in this data set are Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width. Each observation in the dataset also contains the value for the class label, the species name. The Four features were measured from each samples (the length and the width) of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other. The central goal here is to design a model which makes good classifications for new data, in other words one which exhibits good generalization.
The British Statistician and Biologist Ronald Fisher in his paper ‘The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems’ introduced Iris Flower Data Set as an example of Linear Discriminant analysis. This is aliased as Anderson’s Iris data Set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris Flowers of three related species.
The Fisher’s linear discriminant model data set became a typical test case for many statistical classification techniques in machine learning such as Support Vector Machines.
This Data Set is also a good example to explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised techniques in Data Mining.
Fisher’s linear discriminant model can be obtained when the object species are known :class labels and clusters are not necessarily the same.
